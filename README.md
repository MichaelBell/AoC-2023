# Advent of Code 2023 for nanoV

[nanoV](https://github.com/MichaelBell/nanoV) is my tiny RV32E SoC that's on Tiny Tapeout 4.

I thought I'd use Advent of Code 2023 as an excuse to create some small programs using the minimal [nanoV-sdk](https://github.com/MichaelBell/nanoV-sdk) that can be used to prove everything works when the TT04 chips are delivered.
